            <p>Batman is famous for being a superhero who fights crime in Gotham City without any superhuman powers. Instead, he relies on his exceptional intelligence, detective skills, peak human physical condition, advanced technology, and martial arts expertise. He is also known for his dual identity as Bruce Wayne, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist. Batman’s moral code of not killing his enemies and his deep, complex personality, including his tragic backstory involving the loss of his parents, make him one of the most compelling and enduring characters in comic book history.</p>
